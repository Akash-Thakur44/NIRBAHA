## 🚀 How To Run NIRBAHA Locally - The Fast Way

1. **Extract all files** into a single project folder.
2. **Open that folder** in VS Code (or your favorite code editor).

### Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended for all features)

In VS Code, open the terminal and run:

If you have Python 3 installed
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Now, go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

**Tip:** You can also use the VS Code “Live Server” extension (right-click `index.html` → “Open with Live Server”) for auto-reload when editing.

### Option 2: Open HTML Directly  
Just double-click `index.html` and open in your browser.  
(But: For best experience with uploads and navigation, use a local server as above!)
